  abstract =	 {Major figures of twentieth-century philosophy were
                  enthralled by the revolution in formal logic, and
                  many of their arguments are based on novel
                  mathematical discoveries. Hilary Putnam claimed that
                  the L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem theorem refutes the
                  existence of an objective, observer-independent
                  world; Bas van Fraassen claimed that arguments
                  against empiricism in philosophy of science are
                  ineffective against a semantic approach to
                  scientific theories; W.v.O. Quine claimed that the
                  distinction between analytic and synthetic truths is
                  trivialized by the fact that any theory can be
                  reduced to one in which all truths are
                  analytic. This book dissects these and other
                  arguments through in-depth investigation of the
                  mathematical facts undergirding them. It presents a
                  systematic, mathematically rigorous account of the
                  key notions arising from such debates, including
                  theory, equivalence, translation, reduction, and
                  model. The result is a far-reaching
                  reconceptualization of the role of formal methods in
                  answering philosophical questions.},

                  logic rather than the typed systems that were
                  championed by Russell and Carnap, among others. He
                  claimed that nothing important would be lost by
                  eliminating sorts, and the result would be
                  additional simplicity and elegance. In support of
                  this claim, Quine conjectured that every many-sorted
                  theory is equivalent to a single-sorted theory. We
                  make this conjecture precise, and prove that it is

                  theoretical equivalence. Our clarification of

@incollection{halvorson2012physical,
  abstract =	 {Christianity and other monotheistic religions (Islam
                  and Judaism) assume a transcendent and sovereign God
                  who created the universe and continually maintains
                  its existence. Theworld only exists because of an
                  ultimate and supernatural cause which is, as Newton
                  said, ``not blind and fortuitous, but very well
                  skilled in Mechanicks and Geometry'' (Cohen 1978:
                  282). Whether in a general philosophical sense or in
                  a scientific sense, cosmology has always been part
                  of theism, but it is only relatively recently that
                  cosmology based on physics and astronomy has entered
                  the discussion concerning the existence and role of
                  God. A limited application of physics to the study
                  of the universe can be found in the second half of
                  the nineteenth century when the cosmological
                  consequences of the law of entropy increase were
                  eagerly discussed in relation to the Christian
                  doctrines of a world with a beginning and end in
                  time. However, physical cosmology is essentially a
                  twentieth-century science which emerged as a result
                  of the discovery in about 1930 that the universe is
                  in a state of expansion that possibly started a
                  finite time ago. Cosmology as a subdiscipline of
                  physics differsin some respects from mathematical,
                  philosophical and classical observational cosmology,
                  butof course the different approaches are in
                  constant interaction. In a modern sense, physical
                  cosmology became established after the discovery of
                  the cosmic microwave background in 1965 which
                  quickly turned the hot big-bang model into the
                  standard model of the universe. Jim Peebles'
                  Physical Cosmology of 1971, possibly the first book
                  with this title, may be taken as the beginning of
                  modern physical cosmology.},

                  confusion than quantum theory. Physics is supposed
                  to help us to understand the world, but quantum
                  theory makes it seem a very strange place. This book
                  is about how mathematical innovation can help us
                  gain deeper insight into the structure of the
                  physical world. Chapters by top researchers in the
                  mathematical foundations of physics explore new
                  ideas, especially novel mathematical concepts, at
                  the cutting edge of future physics. These creative
                  developments in mathematics may catalyze the
                  advances that enable us to understand our current
                  physical theories, especially quantum theory. The
                  authors bring diverse perspectives, unified only by
                  the attempt to introduce fresh concepts that will
                  open up new vistas in our understanding of future

                  the notion of antimatter is more general than that
                  of antiparticles. Properly speaking, then,
                  antimatter is not matter made up of antiparticles -
                  rather, antiparticles are particles made up of
                  antimatter. We go on to discuss whether the notion
                  of antimatter is itself completely general in
                  quantum field theory. Does the matter-antimatter
                  distinction apply to all field theoretic systems?
                  The answer depends on which of several possible

                  supposed to be a watershed moment in the development
                  of his philosophy of quantum theory, it is difficult
                  to find a clear statement of the reply's
                  philosophical point. Moreover, some have claimed
                  that the point is simply that Bohr is a radical
                  positivist. In this paper, we show that such claims
                  are unfounded. In particular, we give a
                  mathematically rigorous reconstruction of Bohr's
                  reply to the \emph\{original\} EPR argument that
                  clarifies its logical structure, and which shows
                  that it does not rest on questionable philosophical
                  assumptions. Rather, Bohr's reply is dictated by his
                  commitment to provide ``classical'' and
                  ``objective'' descriptions of experimental

                  relativistic quantum field theory have their formal
                  root in the Reeh-Schlieder theorem, which in
                  particular entails that local operations applied to
                  the vacuum state can produce any state of the entire
                  field. It is of great interest then that I. E. Segal
                  and, more recently, G. Fleming (in a paper entitled
                  "Reeh-Schlieder meets Newton-Wigner") have proposed
                  an alternative "Newton-Wigner" localization scheme

                  paper, I reconstruct the Newton-Wigner localization
                  scheme and clarify the limited extent to which it
                  avoids the counterintuitive consequences of the

                  superentangled states exist in any quantum theory,
                  they are dense in its state space. We also give
                  prescriptions for constructing superentangled states
                  that involve an arbitrarily large collection of
                  systems.},
