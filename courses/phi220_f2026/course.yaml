overview:
  description: >
    This course introduces logic, probability theory, decision theory, and argument analysis,
    and teaches students to apply those tools to philosophical issues including limits of computation,
    testimonial evidence, peer disagreement, justification of probabilism, traditional vs Bayesian statistics,
    group coordination, imprecise probability, and the rationality of voting. Students learn argument mapping
    as a technique for representing the structure of prose arguments.
