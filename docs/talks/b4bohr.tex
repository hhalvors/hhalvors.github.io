\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Audience and Speaker}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item I am not (really) a historian of science.
  \item My job description is ``philosopher'', but I think it means
    ``hopelessly interdisciplinary''.
  \item My intended audience today is not \emph{fagfilosoffer}. It is
    primarily people who, like me, (a) care about the ``meaning'' of
    physics, and (b) are confused about the current moment in the
    history of physics.
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Shut up and calculate''
    \item ``Bohr solved the foundational crisis in physics''
    \item ``Philosophy is dead''

  \item Students of physics defect to philosophy

\begin{frame}{My attempt to get unconfused}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bring to bear all the tools of understanding we have:
    mathematical, conceptual, historical
  \item Earlier career: I focused on mathematical clarification
  \item More recently: I have focused on understanding Bohr's thought
    --- which led me to language, culture, and the history of (Danish)
    philosophy
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Why Bohr and not just the history of quantum physics
      generally?

\section{Bohr's philosophy}

\begin{frame}{Objective Description}
  
  ``No man who is called a philosopher really understands what one
  means by the complementary description. \dots They did not see that
  it was an objective description, and that it was the only possible
  objective description.'' (Interview with T. Kuhn, Nov 17, 1962)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``The notion of complementarity does not imply any renunciation of
  detailed analysis limiting the scope of our enquiry, but simply
  stresses the character of objective description, independent of
  subjective judgment, in any field of experience where unambiguous
  communication essentially involves regard to the circumstances in
  which evidence is obtained. In logical respect, such a situation is
  well known from discussions about psychological and social problems
  where many words have been used in a complementary manner since the
  very origin of language.'' \citep[1105]{rutherford}


\nocite{koch2016danske}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``Far from indicating a departure from our position as detached
  observers, the notion of complementarity represents the logical
  expression for our situation as regards objective description in
  this field of experience, which has demanded a renewed revision of
  the foundation for the unambiguous use of our elementary concepts.''
  \citep[54]{unity55}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``By the lesson regarding our position as observers of nature, which
  the development of physical science in the present century has given
  us, a new background has, however, been created just for the use of
  such words as objectivity and subjectivity. From a logical
  standpoint, we can by an objective description only understand a
  communication of experience to others by means of a language which
  does not admit ambiguity as regards the perception of such
  communications.'' \citep[386]{religion54}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Subject and Object}

  ``\dots volition and causation are equally indispensable elements in
  the relationship between subject and object, which is the most
  central problem of epistemology''

  \bigskip ``Samtidig drejer det sig på begge områder om
  idealisationer, hvis naturlige begrænsning kan gøres til genstand
  for undersøgelse og som betinger hinanden i den forstand, at
  viljesfølelse og årsagskrav er lige uundværlige elementer i
  forholdet mellem subjekt og objekt, som er erkendelsesproblemets
  kerne.'' \citep[82]{bohr-atomteori}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Contemplation and Action}

  ``The complementary way in which words like contemplation and
  volition are used has especially to be taken into account when
  turning to the problem of the freedom of the will, discussed by
  philosophers through the ages.'' \citep[66]{unity}

\begin{frame}{The Subject-Object Problem: From Kant to Hegel}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Kant}: Introduced the distinction between the knowing
  subject and the object of experience. The object is constituted
  through the subject's forms of intuition and categories.

\item \textbf{Fichte}: Radicalized Kant — all objectivity arises from
  the self-positing activity of the \emph{I}. The object is a
  projection of the subject’s own limitation.

\item \textbf{Hegel}: Resolved the opposition of subject and object
  through dialectic. The Absolute is the self-unfolding unity of
  subject and object in Spirit (\emph{Geist}).

\end{itemize}  

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hegel}

  ``It is thus `the absolute method of knowing,' a spiritual
  excitation that is the immanent development of the concept. When the
  concept is fully revealed, the recipient of that revelation (i.e.,
  Hegel) has overcome the split between subject and object. The
  history of philosophy is complete and the absolute is present within
  human time. Being and thinking are the same.'' \citep[35]{rosen}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Kierkegaard on Hegel}

  ``Hegelian philosophy culminates in the thesis that the outer is the
  inner and the inner is the outer.'' \newline \emph{Concluding
    Unscientific Postscript}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Kierkegaard on Hegel}

  ``So we return to the two paths of reflection, and have not
  forgotten that it is an existing spirit that poses the question,
  quite simply a human being. Nor can we forget that his existing is
  just what will stop him going both ways at once, while his anxious
  question will prevent him from frivolously and fantastically
  becoming subject-object. Which of these two paths, then, is the path
  of truth for an existing spirit? For only the fantastic I-I is
  finished with both paths all at once, or proceeds methodically down
  both paths simultaneously, a gait so inhuman for an existing human
  that I do not risk recommending it.'' (Postscript, Hannay
  translation, p 162)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Complementarity between reflection (overvejelse) and
    decision (afgørelse)}

  ``Once subjectivity is taken away, and passion from subjectivity,
  and infinite interest from passion, there is absolutely no decision
  [afgørelse] at all, on this problem or any other. All decision, all
  essential decision, lies in subjectivity. At no point does an
  observer (and that is what objective subjectivity is) have any
  infinite need of a decision, and at no point sees it.'' (Postscript,
  p 29)

      There is no object without a corresponding objectification — and
      no objectification without an objectifying subject.
    \end{quote}
    Reality is not given independently, but always mediated by the
    activity of a subject.

  \item \textbf{Harald Høffding}: Extended Nielsen’s insight. Claimed that:
    \begin{quote}
      There is no final or absolute objectifying subject.
    \end{quote}
    Subjectivity itself is historically and psychologically
    conditioned — there is no Archimedean point. Objectivity emerges
    from an evolving network of perspectives.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Objectiveringslov}

  ``No object without a corresponding objectification; it is an a
  priori law that underwrites all empiricism, a basic law that in
  science is, if possible, even more unshakable than Newton's law of
  gravity. From this it can be seen, that a critical boundary, a
  boundary line, on whose one side we have the objectivizing
  subjectivity, while the object is standing on the other side, is
  confused and meaningless.'' \citep[41]{avg}

  \textbf{Central Thesis:} There is no object without an objectifying subject.

  \vspace{1em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Nielsen’s \emph{law of objectification} (\textit{Objectiveringsloven}) states that 
    only what is objectified becomes an object.
    \item The subject plays an active, constitutive role in experience: objectivity is not merely \emph{given} but \emph{formed}.
    \item \textbf{Implication for Bohr:} The epistemological conditions for describing phenomena 
    may already embed subject-object relations, anticipating Bohr’s focus on measurement contexts.
  \end{itemize}

  ``\dots all search for an ultimate subject is at variance with the
  aim of objective description which demands the contraposition of
  subject and object.''  \citep[]{unity}

  \vspace{1em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Physical necessity arises from the law of \textit{Andethed}
      --- the logic of things governed by external relations.
    \item Freedom is grounded in \textit{Selvhed} --- the inner form of the self.
    \item \textbf{No sharp boundary:} The duality pervades all of reality, not just human action.

\subsection{Harald Høffding}

\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``Just as form and content are abstractions, since in every act of
  cognition we have a combination of them, so it is with subject and
  object.''

  \bigskip ``Ligesom Emne og Form ere Abstraktioner, da vi i enhver
  Erkendelsesakt have en Forbindelse af dem, saaledes forholder det
  sig ogsaa med Subjekt og Objekt.'' \citep[297]{hoffding1910}

   \nocite{hoffding1909}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``We could make our own subject an object for us, just as when we
  study it psychologically, e.g. to find out the forms by which it
  works in its cognition. These forms, which are systematized in the
  study of the categories of cognition, must be taken as facts. They
  are made subjects when reflection is applied to them. Every
  cognition takes place from a certain point of view, which it can be
  meaningful to ascertain [konstatere]. We then objectify the
  subject.'' \citep{hoffding1910}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``When we consider something as an object, we must indicate the
  nature of the subject in relation to which it exists. And when we
  consider something as a subject, we must partly seek the objective
  context that determines its nature and thereby the contents and
  forms that are at its disposal, and on the other hand we need to
  note that by this investigation we ourselves make that subject into
  an object (if it is ourselves, then for ourselves in a somewhat
  different state, at any rate at a different moment, than before). We
  never have a pure subject ($S$), but always an objectively
  determined or yet an objectified subject ($S_o$). And we never have
  a pure object ($O$), but always a subjectivized object ($O_s$). $S$
  and $O$ are mere abstractions. What we have before us is always
  $S_o$ and $O_s$.'' \citep[298]{hoffding1910}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\mbox{}}

  ``The act of becoming self-conscious, of making one's I (one's
  conditions, one's work, one's circumstances) into an object for
  itself, can always be repeated. The I that becomes self-conscious
  can itself become the object of a new act of self-consciousness, and
  so on. Such a series $(S_1 \prec S_2 \prec S_3 \prec S_4 \dots )$
  has already been mentioned above in connection with the possibility
  of an epistemological investigation into epistemology.''

  ``Den Akt at blive sig selv bevidst, gøre sit Jeg (sine Tilstande,

  Genstand for en ny Selvbevidsthedsakt, og saaledes fremdeles. En
  saadan Række $(S_1 \{ S_2 \{ S_3 \{ S4 ....)$ er allerede omtalt
