  <h1 class="post-title">Scientific Realism and Anti-Realism</h1>
  
  <p>We said earlier that it’s not of much interest to try to place Niels
Bohr into classification schemes that have been devised by analytic
philosophers in the past fifty years. For example, the question “was
Bohr a Humean about laws of nature?” can hardly be given a clear
answer, since Bohr’s context was so different from that of
contemporary analytic philosophers.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the question “was Niels Bohr a scientific realist?” is a
little more interesting — especially since anti-realists are thought
to be people with a somewhat negative attitude toward science and its
authority to pronounce on philosophical issues.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> What’s more,
although analytic philosophers have tried to give various precise
definitions of realism and anti-realism, those words do come up in
earlier philosophy, and that seem to pick out some kind of genuine
difference, at least in general attitude. For example, Harald Høffding
(Bohr’s teacher) gave a lecture titled “On realism in science and
faith” at the University of Copenhagen in 1882 (more than twenty years
before Bohr began his studies).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know now, it is true, that the often expressed scepticism with
regard to the reality of atoms was exaggerated. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934book">(Bohr 1934, p
93)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without doubt, Bohr’s philosophical views have shaped the way
generations of physicists think about quantum mechanics, but they
have also, in the eyes of an increasing number, discouraged and
stifled progress. Bohr argued that it is wrong to think that the
task of physics is to find out how nature is – or to know the ‘real
essence of the phenomena’ — but rather to concern itself only with
what we can say about nature: the ‘aspects of our
experience’. [Note: No citation here. Presumably Al Khalili is
basing this claim on rumors that were fostered by some things that
Aage Petersen said about Bohr’s view.] These two opposing views, the
first ontological and the second epistemo- logical, can in fact both
be correct: what a physicist should be able to say about nature,
even at the quantum scale, should be the same as how nature is, or
as close to it as we can get, but always trying to edge closer. This
‘realist’ view is one that I have always found myself siding with in
the end, despite having serious doubts now and
again. <span class="citation" data-cites="alkhalili2020world">(Al-Khalili 2020, p 122)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A realist (with respect to a given theory or discourse) holds that
(1) the sentences of that theory are true or false ; and (2) that
what makes them true or false is something external — that is to
say, it is not (in general) our sense data, actual or potential, or
the structure of our minds, or our language, etc. <span class="citation" data-cites="putnam1979phil">(Putnam 1979,
pp 69-70)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Science aims to give us, in its theories, a literally true story of
what the world is like ; and acceptance of a scientific theory
involves the belief that it is true. <span class="citation" data-cites="image">(Van Fraassen 1980, p 8)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in the day, particular instances of realism were a pretty
straightforward matter. … But a completely different account of
what it takes to be “real realist” emerges in several of these
papers. <span class="citation" data-cites="maudlin2007truth">(Maudlin 2007)</span></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>In the metaphysics of laws of nature, both humeans and
non-humeans are speculative metaphysicians: they assume a fixed
framework that usually includes things like possible worlds,
objects in those worlds, properties, etc. Bohr does not begin with
such a framework, but rather with common sense supplemented by the
well-established theories of physics (e.g. Newtonian mechanics,
electrodynamics).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>That seems to us at least to be the worry. But it would seem
very odd to say that, e.g., Ernst Mach had a negative attitude
toward science. What then is the real worry about somebody being
an anti-realist?<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
