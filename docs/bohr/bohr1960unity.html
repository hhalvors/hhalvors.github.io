  <h1 class="page-title">The Unity of Human Knowledge</h1>
     <p>The question alluded to in the title for this address is as old as
civilization itself, but has acquired renewed attention in our days
with the increasing specialization of studies and social
activities. From various sides concern has been expressed with the
widespread confusion arising from the apparently divergent approaches
taken by humanists and scientists to human problems, and in this
connection there has even been talk about a cultural rift in modern
society. We must, however, not forget that we are living in times of
rapid developments in many fields of knowledge, reminiscent in such
respect of the age of European Renaissance.</p>
<p>However great the difficulties of liberation from the medieval world
view were felt at that time, the fruits of the so-called Scientific
Revolution are certainly now a part of the common cultural
background. In our century the immense progress of the sciences has
not only greatly advanced technology and medicine, but has at the same
time given us an unsuspected lesson about our position as observers of
that nature of which we are part ourselves.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr’s view here is
essentially the opposite of what is usually attributed to the
Copenhagen interpretation, as invoking an external observer. For
Bohr the problem is how one part of nature can separate itself as
“subject” and treat another part as “object”.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Far from implying
a schism between humanism and physical science, this development
entails a message of importance for our attitude to common human
problems, which — as I shall try to show — has given the old
question of the unity of knowledge new perspective.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The
lesson from QM can help us get a more nuanced understanding of how
knowledge from different domains can be related and
integrated.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr speaks as if this is an old question —
about the unity of knowledge. What is he thinking of? The theme of
diversity and unity in knowledge had been central for Høffding,
tracing back to his participation in the Viden/Tro debate of the
1860s. The unity of science theme was also central for the logical
positivists.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The pursuit of scientific inquiry with the aim of
augmenting and ordering our experience of the world around us has
through the ages proved fertile, not least for the continual progress
of technology which to so great an extent has changed the frame of our
daily life. While early developments of astronomy, geodesy and
metallurgy in Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China were primarily
directed to serve requirements of the community, it is in ancient
Greece that we first meet with systematic endeavours to clarify the
basic principles for the description and ordering of knowledge.</p>
<p>In particular, we admire the Greek mathematicians, who in many
respects laid the firm foundation on which later generations have
built. For our theme it is important to realize that the definition
of mathematical symbols and operations is based on simple logical use
of <mark>common language</mark>. Mathematics is therefore not to be regarded
as a special branch of knowledge based on the accumulation of
experience, but rather as a refinement of general language,
supplementing it with appropriate tools to represent relations for
which ordinary verbal expression is imprecise or too
cumbersome.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Mathematics is just more language!<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>In view of the apparent remoteness of mathematical abstractions, often
frightening wider circles, it may be noted that even elementary
mathematical training allows school disciples to see through the
famous paradox of the race between Achilles and the
tortoise.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr always liked the idea that mathematics can
help us get out of muddles that we are prone to fall into. Here he
talks about how calculus can help us avoid the trap of Zeno’s
paradoxes of motion. Elsewhere he talks about Riemann surfaces as a
model for disambiguation, and of matrix mechanics as a tool for
avoiding paradox in atomic physics.<br />
<br />
</span></span> How could the fleet-footed
hero ever catch up with and pass the slow reptile if it were given
even the smallest handicap? Indeed, at his arrival at the starting
point of the turtle, Achilles would find that it had moved to some
further point along the race track, and this situation would be
repeated in an infinite sequence. I need hardly remind you that the
logical analysis of situations of this type was to play an important
role in the development of mathematical concepts and methods.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the use of mathematics has been essential for the
progress of the physical sciences. While Euclidean geometry sufficed
for Archimedes’ elucidation of fundamental problems of static
equilibrium, the detailed description of the motion of material bodies
demanded the development of the infinitesimal calculus on which the
imposing edifice of Newtonian mechanics rests. Above all, the
explanation of the orbital motion of the planets in our solar system,
based on simple mechanical principles and the law of universal
gravitation, deeply influenced the general philosophical attitude in
the following centuries and strengthened the view that space and time
as well as cause and effect had to be taken as a priori categories for
the comprehension of all knowledge.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr mixes up the forms
of intuition and the categories of cognition, but these subtleties
don’t matter for him. His point is that there are two different
kinds of cognitive tools that are foundational to physics: spacetime
coordination and cause-effect reasoning. He thinks that in contexts
where the quantum of action makes an appreciable difference,
application of one of these tools excludes application of the
other.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The extension of physical experience in our days has, however,
necessitated a radical revision of the foundation for the
<mark>unambiguous</mark> use of our most elementary concepts, and has changed
our attitude to the aim of physical science.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Elimination of
ambiguity is an essential goal for Bohr. In English, we have to use
the negative ‘unambiguous’, whereas German has the positive
<em>eindeutig</em>, and Danish has <em>entydig</em>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Indeed, from our
present standpoint, physics is to be regarded not so much as the study
of something a priori given, but rather as the development of methods
for ordering and surveying human experience.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Some people
might take this as Bohr’s announcement of an anti-realist view of
physics, i.e. that its aim is prediction rather than description of
reality. But note that his emphasis is on action: physics isn’t just
about describing the data we already have, it’s about gathering and
understanding new data. Physics is an active pursuit of interacting
with the natural world.<br />
<br />
</span></span> In this respect our task must be to account
for such experience in a manner independent of individual subjective
judgment and therefore objective in the sense that it can be
<mark>unambiguously</mark> communicated in the <mark>common human
language</mark>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The task of physics is to provide objective
descriptions of reality, by which Bohr means unambiguous
descriptions.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>As regards the very concepts of space and time reflected in the
primitive use of words as here and there, and before and after, it is
to be remembered how essential the immense speed of light propagation,
compared with the velocities of the bodies in our neighbourhood, is
for our ordinary orientation. However, the surprise that it proved
impossible even by the most refined measurements to ascertain, in
laboratory experiments, any effect of the orbital motion of the earth
around the sun, revealed that the shape of rigid bodies and their
mutual distances would be differently perceived by observers swiftly
moving relative to each other, and that even events, which by one
observer would be judged as simultaneous, by another could be reckoned
as occurring at different moments. Far from giving rise to confusing
complications, the recognition of <mark>the extent to which the account
of physical experience depends on the standpoint of the observer</mark>
proved most fertile in tracing fundamental laws valid for all
observers.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr doesn’t think that relativity theory provides
a context-independent description of the facts. To the contrary, it
makes clear that the facts must be relativized to ‘the standpoint of
the observer’, i.e. a frame of reference. Nonetheless, the
<em>laws</em> hold in all reference frames.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Indeed, the general theory of relativity, by which Einstein in
renouncing all ideas of absolute space and time gave our world picture
a unity and harmony surpassing any previous dreams, offered an
instructive lesson as regards the consistency and scope of <mark>plain
language</mark>. Although the convenient formulation of the theory
involves mathematical abstractions as four-dimensional non-Euclidean
geometry, its physical interpretation rests fundamentally on every
observer’s possibility of maintaining a sharp separation between space
and time and of surveying how any other observer, in his frame, will
describe and co-ordinate experience by means of the <mark>common
language</mark>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">According to Bohr, the mathematical formalism
(four-dimensional manifold) does not represent spacetime
directly. Rather, its physical meaning comes about through its use
by an observer/describer, who knows how to distinguish between space
and time. That is, the ‘new vocabulary’ of GTR gains meaning from
its connection to the manifest image vocabulary of ‘here or there’
and ‘before or after’.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>New fundamental aspects of <mark>the observational
problem</mark><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr is probably thinking here of the Danish word
<em>måleproblemet</em>, which is most literally translated as
<em>the measurement problem</em>. This phrase is used somewhat
differently in the contemporary literature.<br />
<br />
</span></span> entailing a revision of
the very foundation for the analysis of phenomena in terms of cause
and effect, were to be uncovered by the development initiated by
Planck’s discovery of the universal quantum of action in the first
year of this century. In fact, this discovery proved that the wide
applicability of so-called classical physics rests entirely on the
circumstance that the action involved in any phenomena on the ordinary
scale is so large that the quantum can be completely neglected. In
atomic processes, however, we meet with regularities of a novel kind,
defying causal pictorial description but nevertheless responsible for
the peculiar stability of atomic systems on which all properties of
matter ultimately depend.</p>
<p>In this new field of experience, opened by modern refinements of the
art of physical experimentation, we have met with many great surprises
and even been faced with the problem of what kind of answers we can
receive by putting questions to nature in the form of
experiments. Indeed, in the account of ordinary experience it is taken
for granted that the objects under investigation are not interfered
with by the observation.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr suggests that ‘observation
without (appreciable) interference’ is a presupposition of our
practice of communicating our experiences to other people. But it’s
not completely clear what he means by absence of interference. One
possibility is that he simply means that there are objects that have
properties of their own. That is, if I say that there are some
objects that stand in some configuration, then I don’t normally mean
to add the qualification ‘relative to me’.<br />
<br />
</span></span> It is true that when we
look at the moon through a telescope we receive light from the sun
reflected from the moon-surface, but the recoil from this reflection
is far too small to have any effect on the position and velocity of a
body as heavy as the moon. If, however, we have to do with atomic
systems, whose constitution and reactions to external influence are
fundamentally determined by the quantum of action, we are in a quite
different position.</p>
<p>Faced with the question of <mark>how under such circumstances we can
achieve an objective description</mark>, it is decisive to realize that
however far the phenomena transcend the range of ordinary experience,
the description of the experimental arrangement and the recording of
observations must be based on common language. In actual
experimentation this demand is amply satisfied with the specification
of the experimental conditions through the use of heavy bodies such as
diaphragms and photographic plates, the manipulation of which is
accounted for in terms of classical physics. Just this circumstance,
however, excludes any separate account of the interaction between the
measuring instruments and the atomic objects under
investigation.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This passage suggests a complementarity
between description of the measuring device in classical terms and a
precise account of the interaction between the measuring instruments
and the measured object. Is Bohr thinking here of application of the
law of conservation of momentum to the joint system of measuring
device and atomic object?<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Especially this situation prevents the unlimited combination of
space-time coordination and the conservation laws of momentum and
energy on which the causal pictorial description of classical physics
rests. Thus, an experimental arrangement aiming at ascertaining where
an atomic particle, whose position at a given time has been
controlled, will be located at a later moment implies a transfer,
uncontrollable in principle, of momentum and energy to the fixed
scales and regulated clocks necessary for the <mark>definition</mark> of the
reference frame.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Sameness of position over time is definable
only relative to fixed reference frame. (It doesn’t help to add
absolute space, because that then serves as a fixed reference
frame.) However, if there is a physical reference frame, then the
object is not a closed system. What’s more, you are precluded from
speaking of momentum-energy transfer between the object and the
reference frame, because you stipulated that the reference frame is
unmoving.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr talks of physical objects, e.g. clocks and
rods, as ‘defining’ a reference frame. This notion deserves closer
study.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Conversely, the use of any arrangement suited to study
momentum and energy balance — decisive for the account of essential
properties of atomic systems — implies a renunciation of detailed
space-time coordination of their constituent particles.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Here
Bohr stresses that the momentum picture provides an explanation of
essential properties of atomic systems. Hence, an interpretation
that neglects the momentum picture (e.g. Bohmian mechanics) will be
explanatorily defective.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Under these circumstances it is not surprising that with one and the
same experimental arrangement we may obtain different recordings
corresponding to various individual quantum processes for the
occurrence of which only statistical account can be
given.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">There is a sort of explanation here for the
probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. But the explanation is a
bit opaque.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Likewise we must be prepared that evidence, obtained by
different, mutually exclusive experimental arrangements, may exhibit
unprecedented contrast and even at first sight appear contradictory.</p>
<p>It is in this situation that the notion of complementarity is called
for to provide a frame wide enough to embrace the account of
fundamental regularities of nature which cannot be comprehended within
a single picture. Indeed, evidence obtained under <mark>well-defined
experimental conditions</mark> — and expressed by adequate use of
elementary physical concepts — exhausts in its entirety all
information, about the atomic objects which can be communicated in
<mark>common language</mark>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">All that can be said about the atomic
objects is relative to a well-defined context, i.e. the
experimental conditions.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>A detailed account on complementary lines of a new wide domain of
experience has been possible by the gradual establishment of a
mathematical formalism, known as quantum mechanics, in which the
elementary physical quantities are replaced by symbolic operators
subject to an algorism, involving the quantum of action and reflecting
the non-commutativity of the corresponding measuring operations. Just
by treating the quantum of action as an element evading customary
explanation — similar to the role of the velocity of light in
relativity theory as a maximal speed of signals — this formalism can
be regarded as a rational generalization of the conceptual framework
of classical physics. For our theme, however, the decisive point is
that the physical content of quantum mechanics is exhausted by its
power to formulate statistical laws governing observations obtained
<mark>under conditions specified in plain language</mark>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For
unambiguous communication, the context of a description must be
rendered in the shared human language, i.e. the language of the
manifest image.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The fact that in atomic physics, where we are concerned with
regularities of unsurpassed exactness, <mark>objective description can
be achieved only by including in the account of the phenomena
explicit reference to the experimental
conditions</mark>,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Objective description calls for specifying the
state of the subject, not pretending that s/he has disappeared.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
emphasizes in a novel manner the inseparability of knowledge and our
possibilities of inquiry. We are here concerned with <mark>a general
epistemological lesson</mark> illuminating our position in many other
fields of human interest.</p>
<p>In particular, the conditions of analysis and synthesis of so-called
psychic experiences have always been an important problem in
philosophy.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Most likely a nod to Høffding, who was much
concerned with the description of psychological experience.<br />
<br />
</span></span> It is
evident that words like thoughts and sentiments, referring to mutually
exclusive experiences, have been used in a typical complementary
manner since the very origin of language. In this context, however,
<mark>the subject-object separation</mark> demands special attention. Every
<mark>unambiguous communication</mark> about the state and activity of our
mind implies, of course, a separation between the content of our
consciousness and the background loosely referred to as
“ourselves”,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-22" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Objective description demands a clear
demarcation of who is describing (subject) and what is being
described (object).<br />
<br />
</span></span> but any attempt at exhaustive description of
the richness of conscious life demands in various situations a
different placing of the section between subject and
object.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-23" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The subject-object split can be moved around in order
to achieve objective description of different subject matters.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>In order to illustrate this important point, I shall allow myself to
quote a Danish poet and philosopher, Poul Martin M<span>ø</span>ller, who lived
about a hundred years ago and left behind an unfinished novel still
read with delight by the older as well as the younger generation in
this country.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The Danish philosophers Sibbern and M<span>ø</span>ller
rejected Hegel’s claim that he had overcome the subject-object
distinction. M<span>ø</span>ller’s most famous student, S<span>ø</span>ren Kierkegaard,
continued his critique of Hegel.<br />
<br />
</span></span> In his novel, called <em>The
Adventures of a Danish Student</em>, the author gives a remarkably vivid
and suggestive account of the interplay between the various aspects of
our position, illuminated by discussions within a circle of students
with different characters and divergent attitudes to life.</p>
<p>Especially I shall refer to a conversation between two cousins, one of
whom is very soberly efficient in practical affairs, of the type which
then, and even now, is known among students as a philistine, whereas
the other, called the licentiate, is addicted to remote philosophical
meditations detrimental to his social activities. When the philistine
reproaches the licentiate for not having made up his mind to use the
opportunities for finding a practical job, offered him by the kindness
of his friends, the poor licentiate apologizes most sincerely, but
explains the difficulties into which his reflections have brought him.</p>
<p>Thus he says:</p>
<p>My endless enquiries make it impossible for me to achieve
anything.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">M<span>ø</span>ller portrays the licentiate as a one-sided
person who knows how to reflect (<em>at overveje</em>) but not how to
act (<em>at handle</em>). The are strong similarities here with the
“postponement argument” in Kierkegaard’s <em>Concluding
Unscientific Postscript</em>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Furthermore, I get to think about my
own thoughts of the situation in which I find myself. I even think
that I think of it, and divide myself into an infinite retrogressive
sequence of “I”s who consider each other. I do not know at which
“I” to stop as the actual, and in the moment I stop at one, there is
indeed again an “I” which stops at it.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-26" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">M<span>ø</span>ller is poking
fun at the licentiate, who seems to think like a German idealist
philosopher. The licentiate’s creation of a new subject seems to be
a version of Hegelian reflection, where one critically considers
one’s former presuppositions. Recall that Kierkegaard believes that
the solution to this infinite regress of reflection is ‘double
reflection’, brought about by a subjective act of will.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I become
confused and feel a dizziness as if I were looking down into a
bottomless abyss, and my ponderings result finally in a terrible
headache.</p>
<p>In his reply the cousin says:</p>
<p>I cannot in any way help you in sorting your many “I”s. It is quite
outside my sphere of action, and I should either be or become as mad
as you if I let myself in for your superhuman reveries. My line is to
stick to palpable things and walk along the broad highway of common
sense; therefore my “I”s never get tangled up.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the fine humour with which the story is told, it is
certainly not easy to give a more pertinent account of essential
aspects of the situation with which we all are faced. Fortunately, the
risk of falling into the deplorable situation of the licentiate is
small in normal life, where we become gradually accustomed to coping
with practical necessities and learn to communicate in <mark>common
language</mark> what we need and what is on our mind. In such adjustment
the balance between seriousness and humour, conspicuous in children’s
play and equally appreciated in mature life, plays no small part.</p>
<p>The complementary way in which words like contemplation and volition
are used has especially to be taken into account when turning to the
problem of the freedom of will, discussed by philosophers through the
ages.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr uses the English ‘contemplation’ where he uses the
Danish <em>overvejelse</em>. He could just as well have used
‘consideration’, but in any case, the state of mind is detached and
tending in the direction of objectivity.<br />
<br />
The idea that <em>overvejelse</em> is a complementary state of mind to
willing (deciding, believing, and acting) goes back to at least
Kierkegaard, although the word ‘complementarity’ is unique to
Bohr. In the <em>Postscript</em>, Kierkegaard argues that making any
decision requires subjectivity, and so is strictly incompatible with
the state of indifferent contemplation.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Even if we cannot say
whether we want to do something because we gather that we can, or we
can only do it because we will, the feeling of, so to speak, being
able to make the best out of circumstances is a common human
experience. Indeed, the notion of volition plays an indispensable part
in human communication similar to words like hope and responsibility,
in themselves equally <mark>undefinable outside the context in which
they are used</mark>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-28" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Sometimes a concept only makes sense within
a certain context.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><mark>The flexibility of the subject-object separation in the account of
conscious life</mark> corresponds to a richness of experience so
multifarious that it involves a variety of
approaches.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Introspection is a clear case where the line
between subject and object can be moved around.<br />
<br />
</span></span> As regards our
knowledge of fellow beings, we witness, of course, only their
behaviour, but we must realize that the word consciousness is
unavoidable when such behaviour is so complex that its account in
common language entails reference to self-awareness.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-30" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bohr is
no behaviorist. An adequate description of another person requires
reference to the same concepts we use to understand ourselves.<br />
<br />
</span></span> It
is evident, however, that all search for an <mark>ultimate
subject</mark><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-31" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Elsewhere Bohr uses “final subject”.<br />
<br />
</span></span> is at
variance with the aim of objective description, which demands the
contraposition of subject and object.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Here Bohr is working
against the background of the German idealist tradition, where the
subject’s finitude was seen as an impediment to objective
knowledge. Hegel thought the solution was infinite reflection; but
Kierkegaard argued that such a process cannot be completed by a
human being existing in time. Here Bohr agrees with Kierkegaard,
(Rasmus) Nielsen, and (Harald) Høffding in maintaining that humans
shouldn’t aim for a god’s eye view of reality.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Such considerations involve no lack of appreciation of the inspiration
which the great creations of art offer us by pointing to features of
harmonious wholeness in our position. Indeed, in renouncing logical
analysis to an increasing degree and in turn allowing the play on all
strings of emotion, poetry, painting and music contain possibilities
of bridging between extreme modes as those characterized as pragmatic
and mystic. Conversely, already ancient Indian thinkers understood the
logical difficulties in giving exhaustive expression for such
wholeness. In particular, they found escape from apparent disharmonies
in life by stressing the futility of demanding an answer to the
question of the meaning of existence, realizing that any use of the
word “meaning” implies comparison; and with what can we compare the
whole existence?<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-33" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This claim sounds strange at first. But it’s
true that “meaning of” is a binary relation, and hence involves
comparison.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The aim of our argumentation is to emphasize that all experience,
whether in science, philosophy or art, which may be helpful to
mankind, must be capable of being communicated by human means of
expression, and it is on this basis that we shall approach the
question of unity of knowledge. Confronted with the great diversity of
cultural developments, we may therefore search for those features in
all civilizations which have their roots in the common human
situation. Especially we recognize that the position of the
individual within the community exhibits in itself multifarious, often
mutually exclusive, When approaching the age-old problem of the
foundation of so-called ethical values we shall in the first place ask
about the scope of such concepts as justice and charity, the closest
possible combination of which is attempted in all human
societies. Still it is evident that a situation permitting unambiguous
use of accepted judicial rules leaves no room for the free display of
charity. But, as stressed especially by the famous Greek tragedians,
it is equally clear that compassion can bring everyone in conflict
with any concisely formulated idea of justice. We are here confronted
with complementary relationships inherent in the human position, and
unforgettably expressed in old Chinese philosophy, reminding us that
in the great drama of existence <mark>we are ourselves both actors and
spectators</mark>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The actor/spectator duality can be related
directly to the action/contemplation duality.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>In comparing different national cultures we meet with the special
difficulty of appreciating the culture of one nation in terms of the
traditions of another. In fact, the element of complacency inherent in
every culture corresponds closely to the instinct of self-preservation
characteristic of any species among the living organisms. In such
context it is, however, important to realize that the mutually
exclusive characteristics of cultures, resting on traditions fostered
by historical events, cannot be immediately compared to those met with
in physics, psychology and ethics, where we are dealing with intrinsic
features of the common human situation.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If we are to speak of
‘complementarity’ between cultures, it’s only by analogy. We meet
complementarity in the strict sense in physics, psychology and
ethics. Bohr has given examples of all three in this article:
position/momentum, contemplation/action, and justice/charity.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>In fact, as is not least conspicuous in European history, contact
between nations has often resulted in the fusion of cultures retaining
valuable elements of the original national traditions. The question of
how to ameliorate the so-called cultural rift in modern societies,
which has attracted so much attention at this meeting, is after all a
more restricted educational problem, the attitude to which would seem
to call not only for information but, as I think everyone will agree,
also for some humour. A most serious task is, however, to promote
mutual understanding between nations with very different cultural
backgrounds.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rapid progress of science and technology in our days,
which entails unique promises for the promotion of human welfare, and
at the same time imminent menaces to universal security, presents our
whole civilization with a veritable challenge. Certainly, every
increase in knowledge and potentialities has always implied a greater
responsibility, but at the present moment, when the fate of all
peoples is inseparably connected, a collaboration in mutual
confidence, based on appreciation of every aspect of the common human
position, is more necessary than ever before in the history of
mankind.</p>
