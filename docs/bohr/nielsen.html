  <h1 class="page-title">Rasmus Nielsen</h1>
     <p>Rasmus Nielsen 1809-1884 was an incredibly productive philosopher who
was professor at the University of Copenhagen for forty years. (For
chronological orientation: Rasmus Nielsen died the year before Niels
Bohr was born.) He seems also to have been extremely popular, both
among his students and among the public at large. But after his death
in 1884, his influence quickly waned, and he was basically
forgotten.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For the most part, we can only speculate about why Nielsen so quickly
fell out of favor. I think his fall has two related causes. First,
during the “battle over faith and reason” in the 1860s, Nielsen ended
up looking pretty silly in comparison to the young intellectuals such
as Georg Brandes. Second, Nielsen’s entire philosophy was focused on
showing why God’s existence is a necessary presupposition for
scientific knowledge. Since Denmark was rapidly secularizing in the
late 19th century, it’s not surprising that the younger generation
simply lost interest in Nielsen’s philosophy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>We will argue that Rasmus Nielsen’s philosophy is a key part of the
background to Niels Bohr’s thought. Our argument for this claim has
two components. First, and externally, there is a lot of
circumstantial evidence pointing to a connection between Nielsen and
Bohr. Second, and internally, there are several aspects of Nielsen’s
view that are suggestively close to things that Niels Bohr said.</p>
<h2 id="external-connections-between-nielsen-and-bohr">External connections between Nielsen and Bohr</h2>
<p>Up until the 1960s, every student at the University of Copenhagen took
the year long philosophy course called <em>Filosofikum</em>. As a result, all
Danish intellectuals had a common body of knowledge of the
philosophical tradition, and a common set of standards for
philosophical discussion. What’s more, a single professor — such as
Rasmus Nielsen — had a large influence on the philosophical mindset
of the entire educated population.</p>
<p>Nielsen started teaching Filosofikum in the 1840s, and alternating
with Frederik Sibbern, he taught the course into the late 1870s. We
still have access to his lecture notes from many of these courses, and
we also have access to some of the notes that the students took in the
classes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> We also know many of the students who took the course under
Nielsen, and it’s a veritable who’s who of Danish intellectuals.</p>
<p>Here are some of the students who we know took Filosofikum with Rasmus
Nielsen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harald Høffding</li>
<li>Georg Brandes</li>
<li>Christian Bohr</li>
<li>Kristian Kroman</li>
</ul>
<p>It is well-established that Bohr read some Kierkegaard. Nonetheless,
we agree with other scholars that Bohr wouldn’t have nodded his head
and said, “yes, I agree with Kierkegaard.” The problem is that
Kierkegaard’s worldview was too different from Bohr’s — too focused
on the God-human relationship, sin, redemption, etc. And Kierkegaard
doesn’t seem to say anything of relevant to the practice of
science. So, it would seem misguided to look for a direct influence of
Kierkegaard on Bohr.</p>
<p>That leaves open the question of whether there might have been an
indirect influence of Kierkegaard on Bohr. Could Kierkegaard have
influenced a mindset that Bohr himself inherited? Recall that Bohr was
a student at the University of Copenhagen fifty years after
Kierkegaard died. What were the philosophical trends in Copenhagen
when Bohr was a student? It certainly wasn’t trendy to be a Hegelian,
as it was at Cambridge, as Hegel’s philosophy had never really found a
receptive audience in Denmark. There might have been some hints of
neo-Kantianism, which was popular at that time in neighboring
Germany. But there was no neo-Kantian professor at the University of
Copenhagen.</p>
<p>In short, none of the “major” philosophical traditions
(i.e. traditions that one reads about at American universities) was
ascendant in Denmark when Niels Bohr was a student. Not British
empiricism, nor continental rationalism, nor their Kantian synthesis,
nor the Hegelian resolution of Kantian subjectivity. As of 1905,
philosophy in Denmark <em>was</em> Harald Høffding, and Høffding was
eclectic.</p>
<p>Despite his eclecticism, Høffding was profoundly influenced by his
reading of Kierkegaard.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="nielsen-and-kierkegaard">Nielsen and Kierkegaard</h2>
<p>In the 1830s, Hegelianism was in the air at the University of
Copenhagen. The newly appointed professor of theology, Hans Lassen
Martensen, was a right-wing Hegelian; and the prominent author, Johan
Ludvig Heiberg, explicitly adopted a Hegelian viewpoint. It’s not
surprising then, that students like Rasmus Nielsen would follow suit,
and his earliest work was explicitly Hegelian.</p>
<p>Nielsen overlapped at the University of Copenhagen with Søren
Kierkegaard. In fact, we know from Kierkegaard’s journal entries that
they were acquaintances — and that Kierkegaard didn’t have all that
high an opinion of him. While Kierkegaard dawdled as a student, and
never got an academic job, Nielsen quickly finished his degrees, and
was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of
Copenhagen. (Nielsen got the chair that had been held by Poul Martin
Møller until his death in 1838.)</p>
<p>In the mid 1840s, Kierkegaard launched his attack on Hegel, with
publication of the <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em>
in 1846. Rasmus Nielsen was immediately convinced of the correctness
of Kierkegaard’s point of view, and he sought out Kierkegaard for
further discussion. They had a rather close relationship for a couple
of years, until Kierkegaard was put off by the way that Nielsen was
publicizing his views. Their relationship cooled off, but Nielsen
continued to work with an explicitly Kierkegaardian approach. In fact,
it is primarily Rasmus Nielsen who kept Kierkegaard’s ideas alive in
the years immediately after Kierkegaard’s death (1855), and until
Georg Brandes wrote a book about him in 1877.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> (In 1892, Høffding
published a second book about Kierkegaard, focusing on his
philosophical contributions. These two had been in Nielsen’s classes
in the 1860s, when Kierkegaard appeared as a prominent figure.)</p>
<p>One big mystery about Rasmus Nielsen is why his interaction with
Kierkegaard’s philosophy led him to undertake a study of the natural
sciences and their methods. One might have expected the complete
opposite, i.e. that becoming convinced of Kierkegaard’s point of view
would push one further away from “science”. To the contrary, Nielsen
decided that philosophers needed to study ‘naturvidenskaberne’,
i.e. the natural sciences.</p>
<p>(Nielsen’s later works include detailed discussion of recent advances
in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. Nielsen
introduced Darwin’s theory of evolution to Denmark, and he argued that
it is perfectly compatible with traditional Christian doctrines.)
Nielsen was, in an important sense, the first dedicated <em>philosopher
of science</em> in European history.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-darwin">Introducing Darwin</h2>
<p>Rasmus Nielsen was also one of the first philosophers to grapple with
the consequences of Darwin’s theory of evolution.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="mechanism-versus-teleology">Mechanism versus teleology</h2>
<p>Since Descartes, physicists have typically assumed that the only
legitimate explanations of phenomena are mechanical. It’s quite
surprising, then, that Bohr had a more positive view of explanations
in terms of purposes and final causes.</p>
<p>In Aristotelian natural philosophy, it’s perfectly reasonable to give
teleological explanations, i.e. in terms of final causes. The
invocation of final causes was challenged by Galileo, Descartes, and
other early modern scientists. They proposed, instead, to explain in
terms of efficient causes, and more specifically, in terms of
mechanisms.</p>
<p>There were, of course, several philosophers who weren’t convinced that
mechanical explanation suffices. For example, Leibniz had his monads
with entelechies, and Berkeley thought that change always traced back
to an agent’s action.</p>
<p>In the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, Kant argued that thinking in terms of
final causes does play a positive role in scientific reasoning. As a
result, the debate between mechanism and teleology was back on the
table in the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id="no-gods-eye-view-for-humans">No god’s eye view for humans</h2>
<h2 id="the-faith-reason-controversy">The faith-reason controversy</h2>
<p>Many people associate Kierkegaard’s name with the phrase “leap of
faith”, and they naturally assume that Kierkegaard advocated blind
faith, both in God and in Christian doctrine. Even in university
classrooms, Kierkegaard is frequently used as an example of a
“fideist”, i.e. a person who holds that religious truth is beyond the
reach of human reason.</p>
<p>The true story about Kierkegaard is, of course, much more
complicated. To a zeroeth approximation, Kierkegaard was a critic of
“Reason”. But Kierkegaard was in a context, and in that context,
“Reason” was G.F.W. Hegel’s “Wissen” and “Wissenschaft”. If you know
anything about Hegel, you know that his notion of “Wissen” is a far
cry from the pedestrian notion of believing things on the basis of
sufficient evidence. The point is that we need to be cautious about
putting Kierkegaard in a box that simply doesn’t make sense for his
context.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Nielsen — unlike Kierkegaard — was inspired
by the natural sciences. He believed that science (<em>Videnskab</em>) is an
essential part of the task of human life, and that it delivers great
goods to human kind.</p>
<p>Nielsen had been working up to it for many years, and in his book
<em>Grundideernes Logik</em> (1864), he states it directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith and reason are different kinds of things.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can see from his lecture notes, Nielsen had long been preaching
this lesson to his students. However, the publication of the overt
statement was the occasion for a backlash, and most notably by Georg
Brandes who wrote the pamphlet <em>Dualisme i vores nyeste Philosophie</em>
(1866). (Brandes, born in 1842, had just completed his degree at KU.)
In this pamphlet, Brandes attacks Nielsen’s conception of the relation
between faith and reason, arguing that it is as psychological
impossibility to have a faith that is uninformed by considerations of
a rational nature.</p>
<h1 id="for-ide-og-virkelighed">For ide og virkelighed</h1>
<p>From 1869 to 1873, Rasmus Nielsen and collaborators published a
journal called “For Ide og Virkelighed” (For Idea and Reality), coming
to eight volumes in total. The intention seems to have been to resist
the forces of secularism, and what came to be known as the Modern
Breakthrough. Nielsen’s co-editors were Rudolf Schmidt and the
Norwegian novelist Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.</p>
<h1 id="grundtvigianism">Grundtvigianism</h1>
<h2 id="open-questions">Open questions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is not clear how much medieval philosophy Rasmus Nielsen
knew. Nonetheless, there are incredibly strong parallels between
Rasmus Nielsen’s views on faith and reason and the medieval
doctrine of two truths (Averroes, Boetius of Dacia, Siger of
Brabant). The doctrine of two truths says essentially that a
proposition might be true from the point of view of science but
false from the point of view of faith.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be too much of a stretch to think that Rasmus Nielsen’s
views on faith and reason had any direct influence on Niels Bohr
— certainly not on the question of faith and reason, and not even
on Bohr’s idea of “complementary” viewpoints. (Bohr is very
tolerant about religion, and sees value in it, but he definitely
rejects its claims upon him.) Nonetheless, it is perhaps culturally
telling that both of these Danes thought of reality as
“fragmented”, or more accurately, as requiring fragmented points of
view.</p></li>
<li><p>There is much work still to be done in figuring out what Rasmus
Nielsen’s views and arguments were — and teasing out the good
ideas, if there are any. (It’s another task, of course, to try to
tease out the ways in which Nielsen influenced subsequent Danish
thinkers, and perhaps indirectly, other thinkers outside of
Denmark.) Besides his many published works (all in Danish), Nielsen
left handwritten notes that have been preserved by the Royal
Library of Denmark. The library also maintains notes written by
several of his students, including Høffding.</p></li>

<li id="fn2"><p>There are some short expressions of admiration in the literature
– after all, Nielsen had been their teacher. But there is only
one place, to our knowledge, where there is explicit engagement
with Nielsen’s philosophy: in Høffding’s book <em>Danske Filosoffer</em>.
Here Høffding argues that Nielsen’s entire philosophy simply
doesn’t work. Of course, Høffding reduces Nielsen’s philosophy to
a single point (which, to be fair, was Nielsen’s main point):
knowledge is possible only if God exists.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>Høffding explicitly acknowledges his debt to Kierkegaard in his
autobiography, <em>Erindringer</em>.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Høffding recalled: “Det var Rasmus Nielsen og Sibbern, der bleve
mine første filosofiske Lærere. Rasmus Nielsen stod dengang paa
sit Højdepunkt. Han var endnu søgende, betagen af Kierkegaard og
optagen af matematiske og naturvidenskabelige Studier, stræbende
at finde en Vej, ad hvilken disse forskellige Tankeverdener kunde
forenes. Hans propædeutiske Forelæsninger bestode i mit Aar dels i
en Gennemgang af Kierkegaards „Stadier“ , paa Grundlag af et lille
Udvalg, han havde ladet trykke, dels i et kort
erkendelsesteoretisk Omrids. Han talte med Liv og Kraft, ofte
aandfuldt og vittigt, og jeg skylder disse Forelæsninger
overordentligt meget. De satte en Mængde Tanker i Bevægelse hos
mig, som hidtil ikke havde rørt sig.” (p 39)<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
