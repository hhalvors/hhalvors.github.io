  <h1 class="post-title">Søren Kierkegaard</h1>
  
  <p>It was the historian Max Jammer who first claimed a connection between
Kierkegaard and Bohr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt that the Danish precursor of modern
existentialism and neoorthodox theology, Søren Kierkegaard, through
his influence on Bohr, affected also the course of modern physics to
some extent. This can be gathered not only from certain references
and allusions in Bohr’s philosophically oriented writings but also
from the very fact that Harald Høffding, an ardent student and
brilliant expounder of Kierkegaard’s teachings, was the principal
authority on philosophical matters for the young Bohr. We know that
Bohr attended Høffding’s lectures at the University of Copenhagen
and read Høffding’s writings in which Kierkegaard’s philosophy
occupied a prominent place. Furthermore, Høffding and Niels’s
father, Christian Bohr, a professor of physiology at the University
of Copenhagen, were not only colleagues but also intimate friends
who had much in common; Christian Bohr’s anti-Haeckelism and Harald
Høffding’s anti-Hegelianism placed both of them in opposition to
contemporary thought. Kierkegaard’s philosophy of life and
religion, his so-called “qualitative dialectic,” his antithesis
between thought and reality, his contradictory conceptions of life,
and his insistence on the necessity of choice had apparently left a
deep impression on Bohr’s youthful mind. In particular Kierkegaard’s
emphasis on the practical value of thought, his opposition to the
construction of systems, and his insistence that thought could never
attain reality, for as soon as it thought to have done so it
falsified reality by having changed it into imagined reality—all
these ideas contributed to the creation of a philosophical climate
which facilitated the surrender of classical conceptions. Of
particular importance for Niels Bohr was Kierkegaard’s idea,
repeatedly elaborated by Høffding, that the traditional speculative
philosophy, in its claim to being capable of explaining everything,
forgot that the originator of the system, however unimportant he may
be, forms part of the being which is to be explained. “A system can
be conceived only if one could look back on completed existence—but
this would presuppose that one no longer exists. Man cannot without
falsification conceive of himself as an impartial spectator or
impersonal observer; he always necessarily remains a
participant. Thus man’s delimitation between the objective and the
subjective is always an arbitrary act and man’s life a series of
decisions. Science is a determinate activity and truth a human
product, not only because it is man who created knowledge, but
because the very object of knowledge is far from being a thing
ready-made from all eternity. <span class="citation" data-cites="jammer1966conceptual">(Jammer 1966)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his review of Jammer’s book, Leon Rosenfeld scoffed at these
claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misled by superficial coincidences, [Jammer] imagines that Bohr’s
thought has been influenced, through Høffding, by Kierkegaard and
William James. There can be no doubt that his surmise is
unfounded. Bohr was a completely independent thinker; from early
youth, he developed his epistemological ideas single-handed and with
no more philosophical preparation than Høffding’s elementary course
of lectures. What the latter, and still more his father, encouraged
in him was an attitude of open-mindedness and unprejudiced approach
to the problems, and certainly not any reliance on particular
philosophical systems. There was indeed one person who did exert a
real influence on Bohr’s views: this was his brother Harald. Niels
Bohr told me once how much he owed to Harald for the clarification
of his ideas about the function of mathematics, which were of great
moment in the early formation of his more general conception of the
role of language. If anything, Harald strongly dissuaded Niels from
taking any interest in Kierkegaard. As to Williams James, it was
only after the completion of Bohr’s epistemological analysis of
quantum mechanics that his attention was called to the Principles of
Psychology: the similarity of attitudes interested Bohr, but did not
influence him. The author could have inferred all this (or most of
it) from published statements; but he somehow went astray and
ponderously built in a completely fictitious “Kierkegaard-Høffding”
ideology into the discussion of Bohr’s work. This unfortunate error
runs through the whole book and spoils the argument wherever it
intrudes into it. <span class="citation" data-cites="rosenfeld1969">(Rosenfeld 1969)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would Jammer even have suspected that there might be some
connection between Kierkegaard and Bohr? Even without knowing any
specific details, Kierkegaard and Bohr both lived in Copenhagen — a
small city — just a few decades apart. And Kierkegaard was a highly
influential, albeit controversial, figure. The simple fact is that
Kierkegaard “influenced” every intellectual who grew up in Copenhagen
at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>We will come back to Jammer’s claims, but it’s important to point out
first that Rosenfeld’s repudiation of those claims left an indelible
mark on Bohr’s foremost defender, David Favrholdt, who went out of his
way to insist — on every possible occasion — that there was no
influence of Kierkegaard on Bohr.</p>

<p>Kierkegaard, unlike Grundtvig, was no despiser of science. In a

<h2 id="metaphysics-and-logic">Metaphysics and logic</h2>
<p>It might seem that Kierkegaard wasn’t interested in metaphysics or
logic — as analytic philosophers understand these terms. But that
would be a mistake. In fact, Kierkegaard believes that bad views about
these subjects lead to confused views about one’s self and one’s task
in life.</p>

<p>Harald Bohr sent Niels a copy of Kierkegaard’s <em>Stages on Life’s
Way</em>. Bohr reports, in a letter to Harald, that he likes the book, but
that he disagrees with Kierkegaard on several points. As far as we
know, this is the only reference that Bohr ever made to Kierkegaard in
his written works.</p>
<p>It would be more intriguing if we knew that Niels Bohr had read
Kierkegaard’s <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em>, since that is the
book in which Kierkegaard argues most directly against the Hegelian
view of the goals of <em>Wissenschaft</em>. But we have no evidence, not even
indirect, that Bohr read this book.</p>
<p>Harald Høffding had read and absorbed all of Kierkegaard’s
works. Høffding was also shaped directly by Rasmus Nielsen — whose
epistemology and philosophy of science was Kierkegaard-inspired — as
well as by Hans Brøchner.</p>
