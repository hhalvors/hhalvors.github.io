can be found on the official Nobel Prize website.</li>
<li>June 19: Birth of Aage (son), who would also win a Nobel Prize in
physics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-22">1923</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bohr, along with Hendrik Kramers and John Slater, proposes the
Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory, suggesting that energy
conservation might be violated in individual atomic processes
<span class="citation" data-cites="bks1924">(Bohr, Kramers, and Slater 1924)</span>. Bohr’s willingness to abandon energy conservation is
striking, since he will later argue that conservation laws are a
crucial part of quantum-mechanical description.</li>
<li>The BKS theory was eventually refuted, but it played an important
role in the development of quantum mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-23">1924</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bohr elaborates on his correspondence principle, which states that
the behavior of systems described by quantum mechanics replicates
classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers. This
principle was key in developing the quantum theory and connecting it
with classical mechanics.</li>
<li>Easter: Heisenberg makes a first, short visit to Copenhagen.</li>
<li>De Broglie: Matter waves. Einstein had shaken the boat by proposing
that light might be a particle instead of a wave. Now de Broglie
turns the tables by suggesting that material objects
(e.g. electrons) are wave-like. Niels Bohr will become gripped by
the idea that these two pictures provide different kinds of insight
about the physical world. <a href="https://fondationlouisdebroglie.org/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf">On the theory of quanta</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-24">1925</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bothe-Geiger Experiment:</strong> Demonstrates that energy is conserved
in individual processes, contradicting the BKS theory.</li>
<li><strong>Compton-Simon Experiment:</strong> Provides further evidence against the
BKS theory.</li>
<li>July 25: Heisenberg publishes his paper on matrix mechanics, a
formulation of quantum mechanics.</li>
<li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/#HeiMat">Heisenberg and the development of quantum
mechanics</a>
are discussed in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</li>
<li>November 16: Three man paper (Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-25">1926</h3>
<ul>
<li>January 26: Schrödinger publishes his series of papers on wave
mechanics, another formulation of quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>June 25: Born’s statistical interpretation of the wavefunction. This
interpretation was initially resisted by Schrödinger, and is still
resisted by many philosophers today.<br />
</li>
<li>October: Schrödinger visits Copenhagen and delivers lectures. During
this visit, tensions between Schrödinger and Heisenberg arose,
leading to debates about the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>There are conflicting accounts about how this visit went, and about
how Niels Bohr handled himself. The historian of science Mara Beller
argues that Bohr was an intellectual bully who wouldn’t allow
Schrödinger to get a word in edgewise <span class="citation" data-cites="beller1999quantum">(Beller 1999)</span>. And yet,
in letters after the event, Schrödinger described Bohr as
self-effacing.</li>

relationship</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-26">1927</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Differences of opinion begin to arise between Bohr and
Heisenberg. Tensions rise. Bohr leaves Copenhagen for a personal
retreat to Tretten, Norway, and while here, Bohr lands upon the idea
of “complementarity”. (TO DO: It’s not clear that he starts using
this word until he begins drafting the Como lecture. At some point
he also uses the word “reciprocity”.)</li>
<li>March 23: Heisenberg’s article about the uncertainty relations</li>
<li>September 16: B delivers the famous Como lecture, where he formally
introduces the principle of complementarity. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/#ComPri">Explore the principle
of
complementarity</a>
in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</li>
<li>October 24-29: The fifth Solvay Conference takes place, where Bohr
and Heisenberg further develop the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics. It is at this conference that Heisenberg presents
his uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of
physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be
known to arbitrary precision. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-uncertainty/">More on the Solvay
Conference</a> and

<ul>
<li>Solvay conference: Einstein presents the photon box thought
experiment.</li>
<li>Pauli proposes the idea of the neutrino to resolve the apparent
violation of energy conservation in beta decay.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-29">1932</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heisenberg spends significant time in Copenhagen, where he works
closely with Bohr on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. This
period is crucial in solidifying the Copenhagen interpretation as a
leading view in the physics community.</li>

the completeness of quantum mechanics. - <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/">Details on the EPR
argument</a> can be found
in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</li>
<li>B responds with a defense of quantum mechanics, arguing that the EPR
paper misunderstands the nature of measurement and quantum states.</li>
<li>Grete Hermann visits Copenhagen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-32">1936</h3>
<ul>
<li>B hosts an important conference in Copenhagen on the Unity of
Science. This meeting was part of the broader international movement
known as the Unity of Science movement, which sought to integrate
different branches of knowledge into a coherent whole. The
conference brought together prominent scientists and philosophers,
including Otto Neurath and Karl Popper.</li>
<li>The meeting highlighted Bohr’s interest in the philosophical
implications of science and his belief in the need for
interdisciplinary dialogue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bohr, of partial Jewish descent, flees Denmark to escape capture by
the Nazis. Bohr escapes to Sweden by boat and eventually makes his
way to the United States, where he contributes to the Manhattan
Project. (There’s also an exciting story about Bohr’s being flown
from Sweden to England by a British fighter pilot.) <a href="https://www.atomicarchive.com/resources/biographies/bohr.html">Learn more
