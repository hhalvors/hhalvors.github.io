  <h1 class="page-title">Leon Rosenfeld</h1>
     <p>There is much more to Leon Rosenfeld than his relationship to Niels
Bohr — see <span class="citation" data-cites="jacobsen2007leon jacobsen2012leon">(Jacobsen 2007, 2012)</span>. But here we focus on that
relationship. After Bohr’s death, Rosenfeld decided to become the
defender of his ideas and his reputation. However, a strong case can
be made that Rosenfeld is responsible for many miconstruals of Bohr’s
point of view.</p>
<p>One important fact to keep in mind is that Rosenfeld was a Marxist,
and his Marxist historiography influenced his understanding of what
was going on in the physics of his day. (Much of the “inevitability”
talk about the quantum revolution comes from Rosenfeld rather than
from Bohr.) What’s more, Rosenfeld had little interest in and
tolerance for “non-scientific” philosophy. That might partially
explain why Rosenfeld wrote such a negative review of Max Jammer’s
book <em>The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics</em>. Whereas Jammer
suggests some (indirect) influence of Kierkegaard on Bohr, Rosenfeld
states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A much more serious objection must be levelled against the author’s
handling of the epistemological questions. Misled by superficial
coincidences, he imagines that Bohr’s thought has been influenced,
through Høffding, by Kierkegaard and William James. There can be no
doubt that his surmise is unfounded. Bohr was a completely
independent thinker; from early youth, he developed his
epistemological ideas single-handed and with no more philosophical
preparation than Høffding’s elementary course of lectures. What the
latter, and still more his father, encouraged in him was an attitude
of open-mindedness and unprejudiced approach to the problems, and
certainly not any reliance on particular philosophical
systems. There was indeed one person who did exert a real influence
on Bohr’s views: this was his brother Harald. Niels Bohr told me
once how much he owed to Harald for the clarification of his ideas
about the function of mathematics, which were of great moment in the
early formation of his more general conception of the role of
language. If anything, Harald strongly dissuaded Niels from taking
any interest in Kierkegaard. As to Williams James, it was only after
the completion of Bohr’s epistemological analysis of quantum
mechanics that his attention was called to the Principles of
Psychology: the similarity of attitudes interested Bohr, but did not
influence him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rosenfeld also seems to be responsible for the icy reception that
Everett received in Copenhagen in 1956. Rosenfeld later said that
Everett was “undescribably (sic) stupid” and “could not understand the
simplest things in quantum mechanics”.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Bohr never spoke like that
about anybody.</p>
