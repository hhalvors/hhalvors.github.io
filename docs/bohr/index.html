  <h1 class="page-title">Niels Bohr: Philosopher in Action</h1>
     <p>Niels Bohr wasn’t a philosopher by trade, but he was an exemplar of a
scientist who approached his scientific practice in a reflective and
philosophical fashion. Bohr’s work in physics was driven by
philosophical vision; and what he learned by doing physics fed back
into his worldview. Most notably, Bohr frequently referred to “the
epistemological lesson of quantum physics”. Whether or not we agree
with Bohr about what the philosophical lessons of quantum physics
are,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> surely we can admire his attempt to align his worldview with
the deliverances of the empirical sciences. In short, Bohr committed
his life to science, and he developed a philosophy of life that was in
harmony with that commitment.</p>
<p>While we want to understand what Bohr’s “philosophy” was, it has not
proven helpful to try to put Bohr into the classificatory boxes that
analytic philosophers have created. For example, it’s hardly
interesting to ask whether Bohr was a “realist” or “antirealist” if
philosophers cannot make up their mind about what those words
mean.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="why-bohr-and-why-now">Why Bohr and why now?</h2>
<p>Niels Bohr thought hard about the foundations of quantum theory for
fifty years. He traded ideas with the greatest minds of the times,
often dealing with severe criticism. Nonetheless, these days,
discussions of the foundations of quantum theory often begin with
dismissive phrases such as “we won’t consider the Copenhagen
interpretation”.</p>
<p>Let’s set aside the fact that the “Copenhagen interpretation”, as it
emerged after World War II, is hardly what Niels Bohr was pushing
for.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Why should we <em>not</em> consider the view of one of the main
players in the development of quantum physics — and, admittedly, the
most philosophically reflective of those players? Could we please have
a hint about the basic mistake or misconception in Bohr’s point of
view? Where does he go wrong? Adding some citations, to substantiate
the attribution of a view to Bohr, would just be icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, we were trained to think that it takes some work to
figure out what the good ideas are. We were also trained to read
charitably, paying attention to context and linguistic
subtleties. Bohr has not received much of this kind of careful reading
in recent years, so it seems that somebody ought to do it.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Bohr also opined on some of the biggest questions in philosophy —
e.g. free will, the aims of science, etc. Surely it could be
interesting to learn what he thought about such topics.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-with-other-books-on-bohrs-philosophy">Comparison with other books on Bohr’s philosophy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
them. (Matthew 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some decent books out there about Niels Bohr’s philosophy
— by Murdoch, Honner, Folse, and Faye, among others. But what is a
person’s philosophy? Let’s distinguish two ways of thinking about it,
with reference to a famous philosopher (David Lewis) and a fictional
character (Mette the banker).</p>
<p>David Lewis had philosophical views about many things, including
things that 99% of human beings never think about. Lewis had views
about whether numbers exist. He also had views about what the laws of
nature are. And he believed that there are other complete universes
that actually exist. The list could go on and on and on. Lewis was a
person with a <em>system</em> of well-articulated metaphysical views.</p>
<p>In contrast to David Lewis, Mette the banker has never heard about the
thesis of Humean supervenience. If asked whether she believed whether
Humean supervenience is true, she would be puzzled by the question. If
you spelled it out in detail for her, she might say that she hadn’t
thought about it, and couldn’t see what difference it would
make. That’s the key phrase there: “what difference it would
make”. Mette is not a logical positivist, and she is not claiming that
Humean supervenience is unverifiable and hence meaningless. What she
is saying is that she can’t immediately imagine any future choice
where what she chose would depend on her belief (or disbelief) in
Humean supervenience. Mette doesn’t see how the question connects into
her agency.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Mette is an unreflective person. In fact, Mette
might spend a lot of time thinking about the meaning of life and
what’s important to her. She might wonder whether it’s rational to
believe in God, or whether democracy is an ideal form of
government. What she reflects upon is very likely connected to the
choices she has to make in life, e.g. about whether to attend church,
or who to vote for in the next election.</p>
<p>We claim that Niels Bohr is like Mette, only the choices he had to
make in life often related to his practice as a scientist and as an
administrator of a scientific institute. Bohr was faced with decisions
about which papers to write, which calculations to perform, whom to
hire as a postdoc, etc. Some metaphysical, epistemological, and
ethical issues were of direct importance for Bohr’s scientific
practice; but some of the more abstruse metaphysical issues surely
were not. In fact, Bohr seems simply to have been agnostic about some
of the issues that exercise today’s metaphysicians and philosophers of
science.</p>
<p>So we claim that Bohr did have a philosophy — it’s just that having
a philosophy is not the same as having a metaphysical system.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>Q: Did Bohr think that the wavefunction collapses upon measurement?</p>
<p>Bohr never says that the wavefunction collapses upon
measurement. However, he does say that the very notion of a system’s
<em>state</em> makes sense only in the idealization where the system is not
under active observation. [add citation!]</p>
<p>Based on a 1990s classification of interpretations of QM, Bohr then
adopts a “no collapse” interpretation.</p>
<p>Update: There is some new textual evidence that suggests that this
issue is more nuanced.</p>
<p>Q: Did Bohr think that the world is split into two parts — a quantum
part and a classical part?</p>
<p>No, not really. Or more accurately: no, not ontologically. Bohr says
explicitly that the entire world is quantum, including the measuring
devices we use to probe the quantum world. Nonetheless, Bohr says that
the goal of physics is to produce objective descriptions, and that
such descriptions ultimately bottom out in the words of everyday
language such as “here” or “there”.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="camilleri2015niels">(Camilleri and Schlosshauer 2015)</span> describe Bohr’s view in a clarifying way: the
measuring device is described from a functional point of view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for Bohr, such a cut [between measuring apparatus and observed
quantum system] did not originate in dynamical (ontological)
considerations, but rather in functional (epistemological)
considerations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that’s almost right, but I would say that the measuring device
is used to describe something else — not that it is being
described. The cut isn’t in the object being described, it is between
the subject and the object.</p>
<p>There are interesting connections between Bohr’s discussion of the
role of measuring devices and Einstein’s discussion of clocks and rods
— e.g. in “Geometry and experience” <span class="citation" data-cites="einstein1921geo">(Einstein 1921)</span>. Einstein
notes that clocks and rods must themselves obey the laws of
relativity. But if, e.g., a rod is bent by gravitational force, how
can it be the standard for straightness of other rods?</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Many contemporary philosophers look to physics primarily for
<em>ontological</em> lessons, i.e. lessons about what exists and how it
moves. The assumption seems to be that questions about our
epistemological situation are of secondary importance, or ought to
be answered by the complete theory of the physical world. It’s an
old philosophical dilemma: should we first produce a theory of
what there is and then figure out what we’re capable of knowing,
or should we first figure out what we’re capable of knowing and
then produce a theory of what there is?<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>By some standards, Bohr was clearly a scientific realist. For
example, he says that the existence of atoms and their parts has
clearly been demonstrated. By other standards, Bohr was clearly a
an antirealist. For example, he says that it’s impossible to
achieve a God’s eye view of reality. (Bernard Williams indicates
in a few places that if you don’t believe that science can provide
the “absolute conception”, then you’re not a realist.)<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
