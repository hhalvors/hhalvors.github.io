  <h1 class="post-title">The walking stick analogy</h1>
  
  <p>One of Bohr’s favorite analogies for the “new situation we face in
quantum mechanics” is the case of the walking stick. He mentions this
analogy in a couple of his written works (see below), and several of
his acquaintances later recounted his using this analogy with
them. (TO DO: reference these other articles.) In what follows we’ll
first explain the analogy, and then we’ll raise some questions about
what it’s supposed to show.</p>
<p>Before we put the analogy on the table, recall that Bohr said some —
to many of us mysterious — things about there being a movable
dividing line between subject and object. So please keep in mind the
following picture.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the analogy, we have a person holding a walking stick, and two
scenarios. In the first scenario, the person is holding the walking
stick firmly and using it to feel (i.e. “measure”) the shape of some
other objects (e.g. the furniture in a dark room). In the second
scenario, the person is holding the walking stick quite loosely — in
fact, it is more accurate to say that the person is not holding the
walking stick, but feeling (i.e. “measuring”) it with his fingers.</p>
<p>Here is how Bohr describes the two scenarios:</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the human being and the stick together are the
subject, and the atom is the object. In other words, the stick is part
of the subject. While Bohr did not live long enough to follow
discussions in analytic philosophy of science, his description of this
first scenario is very much like Grover Maxwell’s argument against the
observation-theory distinction <span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell1962">(Maxwell 1962)</span>. The point, in short, is
that what counts as observable depends on what we count as belonging
to the subject, and there is no in principle reason to restrict “the
subject” to the physical flesh of a human being. Think especially of
eyeglasses, binoculars, or microscopes. A person with eyeglasses (to
correct their vision) is no doubt a subject — the eyeglasses are
part of the subject. So why wouldn’t we count a person with binoculars
as a subject? That was Maxwell’s point, and we feel sure that Bohr
would have agreed with him.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, the person is touching the stick — but the
stick is no longer to be counted as part of the subject. Why not? If
we were thinking in a purely metaphysical mode, we might be completely
baffled at this point. What counts as a single entity? In both cases
(first and second scenarios), the person is touching the stick. Why in
the first scenario is the stick part of the subject, but not in the
second scenario? Should we appeal to something like the strength of
the binding forces between them?</p>
<p>No, that’s not how Bohr is thinking of the example. What constitutes a
subject is not a fact about the subject-less ontology of the world: it
is partly up to the subject him/herself to determine what is part of
him/her. For example, if someone tells me that I’m just a certain bag
of bones, then I could cut my pinky finger off — and then the
subject has a different constitution. Or, less violently, I could put
on a pair of gloves.</p>
<p>This is not very different from Kant’s problem of the unity of
consciousness.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> What makes a single subject? Nobody has a good answer
to that question, but one thing that Bohr insists on is that the
subject is not a transcendental, disembodied entity. The subject
corresponds to some physical stuff, it’s just that the boundary of
this stuff is determined by a unity of consciousness that all of us
experience, and that nobody has been able to derive from physics or
any other empirical science.</p>
<h1 id="sources">Sources</h1>
<p>Bohr uses the walking stick analogy first in an article from 1929.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relativity of our perception of motion, with which we become
conversant as children when travelling by ship or by train,
corresponds to common-place experiences on the reciprocal<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> character
of the perception of touch. One need only remember here the
sensation, often cited by psychologists, which every one has
experienced when attempting to orient himself in a dark room by
feeling with a stick. When the stick is held loosely, it appears to
the sense of touch to be an object. When, however, it is held
firmly, we lose the sensation that it is a foreign body, and the
impression of touch becomes immediately localized at the point where
the stick is touching the body under investigation. <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1934book">(Bohr 1934,
p 99)</span>, a translation of <span class="citation" data-cites="bohr1929wirk">(Bohr 1929)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-measuring-device-is-quantum">The measuring device is quantum</h2>
<p>There’s a common misunderstanding of Bohr’s point of view: that he
thought that the world can be divided up into a quantum part and a
classical part. Well, there is a sense in which that is true,
viz. Bohr thinks that the self-understanding of the subject is given
in ordinary language supplemented by the terminology of classical
physics. Bohr doesn’t have an argument for why that is true; he just
says it happens to be the case for human beings.</p>
<p>However, the stick analogy shows, among other things, that Bohr
believes that the “ontological type” of the subject is no different
than the ontological type of atoms, viz. mostly correctly described
by quantum physics. In the second scenario, the stick (read: measuring
device in first scenario) belongs to the object that is being
measured. But the object being measured is subject to the laws of
quantum mechanics, hence the stick is subject to the laws of quantum
mechanics. Or to put it in a different way: the object has states that
can be superposed, and can be entangled with other objects. Hence the
stick has states that can be superposed, and can be entangled with
other objects.</p>
<p>Finally, what’s true about the stick is true about every part of the
original subject, without remainder. Hence, the original subject is
ontologically of the same type as atoms — it has states that can be
superposed, and it can be entangled with other objects.</p>
