  <h1 class="post-title">Causality</h1>
  
  <p>Bertrand Russell famously claimed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among
philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the
monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell seems to have thought himself to be reporting a widespread
attitude among natural scientists, especially physicists. We doubt
that he was correct about that. But in any case, something like
Russell’s view has been quite popular among (analytic) philosophers
— from the 1950s and until today. Indeed, these philosophers believe
themselves to be carrying forward the austere program of David Hume.</p>
<p>As usual, it’s not completely straightforward to figure out Niels
Bohr’s views on a philosophical topic. He rarely states his views
directly, much less argues for them. What’s more, Bohr bends his
philosophical views in reaction to developments in his scientific
practice. Bohr’s views about causality offer an extreme example of his
philosophical flexibility. At times he insists that the principle of
causality must be maintained; and at other times he insists that we
have no reason to think that nature will comply with our apriori
principles of intelligibility.</p>
<h2 id="hume-and-kant">Hume and Kant</h2>
<p>David Hume famously criticized the traditional view about causes in
nature and our knowledge of them. This traditional view has two
components, one metaphysical, and one epistemological. The
metaphysical component says that there is a relation between events
where the former <em>causes</em> or <em>brings about</em> the latter. For example,
we would tend to think that a rock striking a thin window pane causes
that window pane to break. Similarly, we tend to think that a person’s
recovering from strep throat is caused by their taking penicillin.</p>
<p>The traditional view also has an epistemic component, namely that
humans are capable — somehow or other — of coming to know that one
thing causes another. Perhaps we get to know that one thing causes
another after seeing a single instance, or perhaps it takes our seeing
many instances. Details aside, the important fact is that somehow or
other, human beings are able to know fairly reliably that one kind of
event causes another kind of event.</p>
<p>We won’t review here the elements of Hume’s critique. What’s important
for us is tha Hume convinced himself that the traditional view of
causality is untenable. What’s more, Kant was convinced that knowledge
of nature is possible only if we know about cause-effect relations,
and so he thought that something must go wrong with Hume’s argument.</p>
<p>Historians of philosophy disagree about whether Hume himself had a
‘solution’ to his argument against causality. It was rather popular in
the late 20th century to see Hume as proposing an “empiricist
acceptable” analysis of the cause-effect relation. The idea here is
that Hume is willing to give up the metaphysical component of the
traditional view – i.e. that there is some “thick” relation (as
suggested by “bringing about”) – in order to save the fact that we
can know that one event causes another. In short, if one can show that
“x causes y” can be cashed out in terms of facts to which we clearly
do have empirical access, then our knowledge of causal relations can
be saved.</p>
