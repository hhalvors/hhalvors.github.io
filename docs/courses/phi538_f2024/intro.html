free-for-all about the topics of the seminar. The goal of the latter
is to set a baseline for improvements in our views throughout the
semester.</p>

<li><p>Eight sessions with HH, then Carlo Rovelli leads four</p></li>
<li><p>Each session is 1hr math and 1.5hrs discussion</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Math part based on Malament’s <em>Foundations of General Relativity</em></p></li>
<li><p>Discussion part based on Earman’s <em>World Enough and Spacetime</em> and
selected additional papers</p></li>
<li><p>Focus topic is substantivalism vs relationalism about
spacetime. We will also make brief forays into causality, the
direction of time, and foundations of quantum mechanics.</p></li>

<h2 id="what-has-physics-to-do-with-philosophy-and-other-meta-philosophical-questions">“What has physics to do with philosophy?” and other meta-philosophical questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Generalized empiricism: our data includes the theories and practice
of physics</p></li>
<li><p>In an old-fashioned (circa 1989) view, the job of the philosopher of
physics is to <em>interpret</em> the theories of physics: to say what the
world must be like in order that these theories could be true. But
that seems to be based on an analogy (with formal logic) that
doesn’t really apply to scientific theories.</p></li>
<li><p>Possible worlds framework</p>
<p>Many of the debates in philosophy of physics are carried out in the
(vague) possible words framework that was so powerfully employed by
Lewis et al.</p>
<p>A common sort of question is how the models of a theory <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> are
related to possible worlds. E.g. do isomorphic models necessarily
represent the same possible world?</p>
<p>HH: The pseudo-precision of this framework now brings about more
confusion than clarification.</p></li>
<li><p>Semantic disputes, or just how agnostic can one be without quitting
philosophy?</p>
<p>HH: The idea of a single, preferred formulation is absurd. One’s
metaphysical commitments are captured not just by the formulation
one accepts, but by one’s tolerance for re-formulation. Example:
spacetime manifolds versus Einstein algebras.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of philosophy of physics is driven by some (ill-defined)
commitment to the “grand naturalist project”. E.g. mentaculus</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of philosophy of physics is about the extent to which the
deliverances of physics call for revisions of the manifest image.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of philosophy of physics is about how to understand relations
between theories – especially equivalence and reduction.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="presentism-versus-eternalism">Presentism versus eternalism</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Einstein’s special theory of relativity (1905) has been taken by
some to provide new, and rather decisive, evidence for eternalism.</p></li>
<li><p>Why? Space and time put together into a four-dimensional manifold
<span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>. And there is no preferred way to divide <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> up into a sequence
of successive “nows”.</p></li>
<li><p>Rovelli argues that neither presentism nor eternalism is right.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="substantivalism-versus-relationalism">Substantivalism versus relationalism</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The classic debate is found in the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence,
with Clarke defending Newton’s view that space is eternal and
unchangeable, and Leibniz arguing the space is a manifestation of
relations between created objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Logical positivists (Schlick, Reichenbach) argued that Einstein’s
general theory of relativity (1915) provides new, and rather
decisive, evidence for relationalism.</p></li>
<li><p>1960s and 70s philosophers (Putnam, Earman, Nerlich, etc.): the
positivists didn’t understand how GTR works. It’s actually much more
friendly to substantivalism.</p></li>
<li><p>1980s Earman and Norton: substantivalism leads to absurdity.</p></li>
<li><p>HH: GTR quantifies over spacetime points. But it doesn’t name
points, and treats them as interchangeable. Hence, the user isn’t
forced into anything like robust existential commitment.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, I don’t take quantifiers to indicate mandatory
existential commitment, especially when there are alternative
formulations that do not quantify over the same things.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-direction-of-time-and-reductionism">The direction of time (and reductionism)</h2>
<p>There’s an apparent contradiction between the following three facts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Thermodynamics is manifestly directed, e.g. entropy never decreases
in the forward time direction</p></li>
<li><p>Fundamental physics is manifestly time reversal invariant</p></li>
<li><p>Thermodynamics is reducible to statistical mechanics</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most popular approach is to look for an <em>ontological</em> solution to
this paradox — e.g. to deny #2, or to add a direction of time into
the “best system” of local matters of fact.</p>
<p>HH: I prefer to question #3. What’s more, I’m simply not bothered by
the fact that there is a feature of our manifest experience that
cannot be reduced to fundamental physics. We should try to understand
how the description from physics coheres with what else we know about
the world (possibly making updates on both sides of the equation), but
no apriori reason to expect reducibility.</p>
<h2 id="causality-and-reductionism">Causality (and reductionism)</h2>
<p>Causality doesn’t appear in Newtonian mechanics. This led some
philosophers (e.g. Russell) to conclude that causality isn’t part of
the fabric of the world.</p>
<p>The argument here isn’t quite as tight as for the direction of time,
especially since Newtonian particle mechanics is no longer considered
fundamental, having been replaced by quantum field theory. However,
causality is typically thought to be temporally asymmetric, whereas
“non-problematic” fundamental physics is temporally symmetric.</p>
<p>This issue is complicated by the fact that there are dozens of
competing philosophical analyses of causation, e.g. counterfactual,
conserved quantity, interventionist.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-of-quantum-mechanics">Philosophy of quantum mechanics</h2>
<p>According to many philosophers of physics, the quantum theory of
undergraduate physics textbooks is <em>inconsistent</em>, and so cannot
possibly be true. In fact, some go further and say that quantum theory
is not even a physical theory in any reasonable sense of the word.</p>
<p>The basic issue is that textbooks say things like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we make a measurement, then the state of the system collapses
instantaneously to a new state that has a sharp value for the
measured quantity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they don’t say what counts as a measurement, nor do they describe
this collapsing process by the same laws it uses to describe other
processes. Either the theory predicts something false (no collapse),
or it is incoherent (collapse as ad hoc modification of the laws).</p>
<p>One cheap (non-philosophical) way out is to say: “don’t worry about
what quantum physics says about the world; it works just fine.” That
way out isn’t available to those of us who aspire to be generalized
empiricists.</p>
<p>Another cheap (non-scientific) way out is to say: “aha, this is where
mind meets matter! The connection is, as Descartes pointed out,
incomprehensible!”</p>
<p>Rovelli isn’t as harsh as the philosophical critics, but neither does
he take the easy way out. He thinks that QM has a profound
metaphysical lesson: there are no absolute facts, but only facts about
one object relative to another object.</p>
