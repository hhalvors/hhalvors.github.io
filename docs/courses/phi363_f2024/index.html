     <p><em>The official, and up to date, version of this syllabus is locked in
the bowels of the Canvas LMS.</em></p>
<p>Monday/Wednesday 1:30-2:50, McCosh Hall 60</p>
<p>Hans Halvorson, (220 1879 Hall, Office Hours TBA)</p>
<p>Z Quanbeck (3-N-21 Green Hall, Office Hours TBA)</p>
<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
<p>This course investigates the concept of “objectivity” with special
reference to its relationship to science and religion. We will examine
the revolt against objectivity by 19th-century religious thinkers such
as Kierkegaard, and the impact this revolt might have had on the
development of the sciences—in particular, on the major revolutions in
physical science in the 20th century (e.g., Einstein's relativity, and
quantum physics). We will also consider the scope of objectivity in the
social sciences, as well as the relationship between objectivity and
values in accepting scientific theories, making religious commitments,
and forming beliefs in other domains. </p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Gain a nuanced understanding of various historical and contemporary
conceptions of objectivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop one’s own considered views about objectivity in science,
religion, and other domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully reflect on one’s own scientific, ethical, and/or religious
beliefs and practices in light of philosophical concepts discussed
in the course.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve one’s skills in understanding dense, argumentative texts.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve one’s analytical writing skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve one’s discussion/verbal communication skills.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assessments-and-grading">Assessments and grading</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Short Written Assignments (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the semester, students will submit various short
written assignments (e.g., reconstructions or critical
evaluations of the arguments from course readings). Many of
these written assignments will be completed in class. Regularly
attending class and completing assigned readings before class is
necessary to do well on these assignments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Participation (25%)</p>
<ul>
<li>See the more detailed description of the guidelines and
expectations for participation below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Two oral exams (30% total; 15% each)</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will complete two oral exams which will essentially
consist in an extended one-on-one philosophical conversation
with a course instructor. The first oral exams will be scheduled
during the week of 9/30. The second oral exams will be scheduled
during the week of 11/4.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Final exam (25%)</p>
<ul>
<li>The final written exam will take place during the official final
exam period on December 14<sup>th</sup> at 8:30 AM.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*</strong>Note that there are no opportunities to earn extra credit for this
course.</p>
<h2 id="participation-guidelines-and-expectations">Participation guidelines and expectations</h2>
<p>This is a primarily discussion-based class. During class time, we will
focus on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Understanding the philosophical arguments offered in the readings,
and</p></li>
<li><p>Asking as a group whether these philosophical arguments are
persuasive.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, we will not be lecturing extensively beyond briefly
introducing and contextualizing the readings.</p>
<p>Accordingly, each of you is expected to participate actively and
constructively in discussions. This involves both speaking and
listening. Listening attentively to those with views different from your
own is essential to being able to tell whether your initial view of the
topic being discussed is in fact the best one. Speaking constructively
in class likewise involves thoughtfully addressing discussion questions
or responding to your classmates’ comments and views in a way that
clarifies or advances the class discussion. While disagreement and
vigorous debate are encouraged, it is important to approach class
discussion with a spirit of respect, interpretive charity, and humility.
Dominating or monopolizing a conversation in a way that prevents others
from joining the conversation should be avoided.</p>
<p>You will lower your grade by having unsatisfactory attendance or by
being disruptive or disrespectful in class. You can raise your
attendance and participation grade by participating regularly in class
discussion, making particularly insightful or helpful contributions to
class discussions, coming to office hours to discuss the course content,
or completing discussion reconstruction assignments to demonstrate
engagement with class discussion.</p>
<p>Discussion reconstructions may be submitted via Canvas up to once per
class and are due by midnight the day the discussion took place. This
assignment requires you to reconstruct part of a full-class or
small-group discussion in 1-2 paragraphs (roughly 200-300 words). The
discussion must include at least two interlocutors (which can include
yourself or the instructor, but at least two people cannot be you). You
should 1) describe the philosophical content of each comment, and 2)
explain its contribution to the class discussion. When explaining 2),
please identify which of the “<a href="https://obailey.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/5/6/105611057/but_how_do_i_participate_.pdf">20+1 ways to contribute to a
philosophical
conversation</a>”
each comment made. (If you think it made multiple types of
contributions, you may list more than one way.) You may (but are not
required to) briefly add your own commentary about the discussion. </p>
<h2 id="reading-materials-and-course-website">Reading materials and course website</h2>
<p>All readings will be available online or via our course Canvas site. See
the reading and exam schedule for more details.</p>
<h2 id="grading-scheme">Grading scheme</h2>
<p>Grades will be assigned according to the standards described
<a href="https://ua.princeton.edu/policies-resources/academic-regulations/grading">here</a>.
Percentage grades will be converted to letter grades as follows:</p>
<p>A+ 100% to 97%</p>
<p>A &lt; 97% to 94%</p>
<p>A- &lt; 94% to 90%</p>
<p>B+ &lt; 90% to 87%</p>
<p>B &lt; 87% to 84%</p>
<p>B- &lt; 84% to 80%</p>
<p>C+ &lt; 80% to 77%</p>
<p>C &lt; 77% to 74%</p>
<p>C- &lt; 74% to 70%</p>
<p>D &lt; 70% to 60%</p>
<p>F &lt; 60% to 0%</p>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course policies</h2>
<p><strong>Re-grading</strong>: We are always willing to meet to elaborate further on
comments you receive on assignments. However, grades on assignments will
not be changed. While there is no system to ensure perfect fairness and
accuracy in grading, selective “re-grading” at students’ request
generally makes things worse. “Second grades” are likely to be less
accurate and less fair than “first grades.” This is because, among other
things, we will not have fresh on our minds other students’ papers for
purposes of comparison. Moreover, the student will inevitably supply
additional input (clarifications, explanations, etc.) that the original
paper did not, and this changes our grounds of assessment in a way which
is unfair to students who do not supply such additional input. The only
exception is suspected arithmetical or recording errors.</p>
<p><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Our scheduled office hours are “drop in,” which means
you can attend without giving any prior notice, and anyone is welcome to
enter and leave as they like. You are warmly encouraged to attend
whenever you like, and/or to coordinate with classmates to attend
together. Office hours provide a terrific opportunity to further discuss
course material (or related philosophical ideas) and understand it
better.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>: Research shows that the use of laptops, tablets, and
phones in the classroom provide distractions that inhibit learning. For
this reason, we discourage using laptops, tablets, or phones during
class and ask that you <u>print out readings before class</u>. If
you feel strongly that using your laptop or tablet to take notes during
class will facilitate your learning, however, we ask that you only use
it to take notes and take care not to distract your classmates.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity and AI</strong>: Intellectual honesty is vital to an
academic community and for our fair evaluation of your work. All work
submitted in this course must be your own – so the ideas must not
derive from or be written by generative AI – and completed in
accordance with the <a href="https://rrr.princeton.edu/students-and-university/24-academic-regulations">University’s academic
regulations</a>.
Please be aware that we will refer any suspected infractions of the
honor code or the University’s academic regulations to the Honor
Committee or the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. If you are
found to have plagiarized or copied the work of another scholar or
student on any portion of an assignment or exam, you will receive an
automatic “0,” which may result in a failing grade for the course.</p>
<p>That said, we recognize that generative AI can be a useful tool for
improving your thinking and writing, so we would encourage you to use
generative AI responsibly to provide feedback on your work. Please ask
us if you have questions about the appropriate use of generative AI in
this course.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong>: We strive to create a respectful and
welcoming environment for all students and expect the same from both the
instructional team and members of the course. Our course and dialogue
are enhanced by the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and lived
experiences among all who are a part of this course.</p>
<p>We will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is
different from what appears on the official roster and by the gender
pronouns you use. You can let us know by email or in class.</p>
<p><strong>Disability Services and Academic Accommodations</strong>: Students must
register with the Office of Disability Services (ods@princeton.edu;
258-8840) for disability verification and determination of eligibility
for reasonable academic accommodations. Requests for academic
accommodations for this course should be made at the beginning of the
semester, or as soon as possible for newly-approved students. We
encourage students with approved accommodations to contact us at the
beginning of the semester, and again before major course assessments.
Please note that no accommodations for a disability will be made without
authorization from ODS, or without advance notice.</p>
