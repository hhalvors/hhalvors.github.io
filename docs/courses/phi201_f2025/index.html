<strong>About this course </strong>
</summary>
<p>The goal of this course is not to produce a <em>product</em>. Rather, it is
to improve the ways that you think.</p>
<p>Logic is the oldest and most foundational of the university
disciplines — having been taught every year for at least a thousand
years. The goal is to equip you with most general possible framework
for sound and rigorous reasoning — one that will support you in any
intellectual activity you pursue (e.g. mathematics, politics,
chemistry, English literature, law, religion, etc.). What’s more,
logic aspires to be independent of the quirks of a particular natural
language, programming language, or mathematical system. In this sense,
logic aims to to capture that which is universally rational. (We might
argue later about the extent to which logic is universal, but we will
have to use logic to do that!)</p>
<p>While this subject has been taught for over a millenium, the content
got an overhaul in the mid 1900s, when modern symbolic logic was
consolidated. (The content has been stable since the 1950s.) Since
then, the standard format for an introductory logic class has been to
learn the “predicate calculus” in three steps: propositional logic,
monadic predicate logic, polyadic predicate logic. We follow this same
outline, but with a few twists.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We emphasize reasoning techniques (natural deduction) over
calculational techniques (truth tables or trees).</li>
<li>We teach proofs before truth tables. It’s harder, but makes your
brain stronger.</li>
<li>We incorporate more analysis of arguments in natural language
(e.g. argument mapping).</li>
<li>We illustrate logical concepts, when helpful, by displaying them
concretely in the general framework of functional programming
languages. However, this course presupposes no background in
programming, nor does it presuppose that students are interested in
programming.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Logistics</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>One 80 minute lecture, and one 80 minute “workshop” (i.e. precept)
each week</li>
<li>Problem sets approximately every week (20% of grade). Drafts of all
psets are linked to this page. However, the official pset is not
released until seven days before the due date. <strong>One pset may be
dropped.</strong></li>
<li>In class midterm exam, Monday of midterms week (25% of grade)</li>
<li>In precept quiz (10% of grade)</li>
<li>In class final exam (40% of grade)</li>
<li>Engagement and participation (5% of grade)</li>
<li>We are unable to accept late homework, except in case of a
documented medical or family emergency.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recommended work protocol </strong>
</summary>
<ol type="1">
<li>Weekend before lecture
<ol type="a">
<li>Look over next problem set</li>
<li>Skim relevant section of text</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Monday: Attend lecture and take notes</li>
<li>Between lecture and precept
<ol type="a">
<li>Read text more closely</li>
<li>Work on pset</li>
<li>Look at feedback on previous week’s pset</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Wednesday: Attend precept
<ol type="a">
<li>Review previous week’s pset</li>
<li>Work on this week’s pset</li>

<strong>Academic integrity </strong>
</summary>
<p>The policy for this course is that collaboration between students is
encouraged, but in no case should one student copy another’s
work. That is hardly a precise criterion, but the spirit of the law is
that you need to <em>understand</em> what you write down on your paper. If
you fail to do that, then your lack of understanding will most likely
reveal itself on the exam. As a general rule, we would suggest that
you put away any notes from joint brainstorming sessions before
writing your final answers.</p>
<p>Please note that LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) are not exemplars of rigorous
logical reasoning – which is precisely the skill that we will be
teaching (and testing) in this course. For example, ChatGPT has
insisted to me that Peirce’s law can be proven constructively (which
it provably cannot be). If you use AI, don’t assume that it’s correct
about logic.</p>

<strong>Notes for instructors (retrospective)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>AIs can solve many logic problems now, especially translation from
English to symbolic language. If our goal is to instill ability into
students, then we must avoid giving them assignments that they are
tempted to have an AI solve. In the past, I’ve made take-home
problem sets bear most of the weight of the course grade. That
approach no longer makes sense (in a world where students are not
infinitely self-disciplined and motivated to learn the material).</li>
<li>I still don’t think there is an ideal “system” to teach logical
reasoning. I eschew trees, as they don’t involve any “deducing” or
“supposing”, which are skills I want to teach. I really like
Fitch-style proofs, but they are meta-theoretically opaque. That’s
why I use the style pioneered by E.J. Lemmon, which is sort of a
half-way-house between natural deduction and the sequent calculus.</li>
<li>This course originally had two lectures and one precept each
week. “Precept” is Princeton’s weird name for a small-group section
(with maximum 14 students). I have since switched to one long
lecture and one long small-group section each week. But we are still
figuring out how to run a good section meeting. This semester, one
of the instructors (Pacy Yan) had the interesting idea of giving an
“exit ticket” the last fifteen minutes of each precept.</li>
